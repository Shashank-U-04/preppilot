## Local setup

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=

   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=   # optional — enables server-side plan activation
   GROQ_API_KEY=                    # required for AI hints and mock interviews
   JUDGE0_API_KEY=                  # RapidAPI key for code execution
   RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
   RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
   ```

3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. To seed problems into Firestore:
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/seed-problems.ts
   npx tsx scripts/seed-aptitude.ts
   ```

## First admin

Manually set `role: "admin"` on your user document in the Firebase Console. All subsequent role management can be done through the admin panel at `/admin`.

## Deployment

Vercel is the recommended host — it picks up Next.js 16 and environment variables automatically. The `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable must be set in the Vercel dashboard for payments and admin stats to work in production.

## Running tests

```bash
# Unit / integration
npm test

# Playwright e2e
npx playwright test
```
